`Eureka Server`: Maintains a list of all microservices running in a microservice architecture. It knows at which IP addresses these services are running and from which ports they can access. This information can be used by other services to connect to the machine on which a service is running. It monitors the running status of the services and warns other services if they are not running, and allows another service to run instead of this service.
